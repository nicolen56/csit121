        <h2> Gaming</h2>
        <p>I seriously love gaming. I started gaming when I was 3 with my older brother and I haven't stopped since. I play a pretty good variety of games like MMORPGS when using PC and more combat based games (Mortal Kombat, Call of Duty, battleground games, etc.) when using console. I usually don't play anything during the semester so I'm really looking forward to it when the semester ends. </p>
